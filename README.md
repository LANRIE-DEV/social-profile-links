## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex

### What I learned

1. I learnt how to use an ARIA attribute used for accessibility purposes.
    
    The 'aria-labelledby' attribute is used to associate the element with one or more elements that serve as labels or descriptions for it. In this case, the value '"cardTitle"' likely refers to the ID of an element that acts as the label or title for the element with the 'aria-labelledby' attribute.

```html
<article aria-labelledby="cardTitle" class="card">
```
